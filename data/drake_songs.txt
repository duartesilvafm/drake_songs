top and its crowded below my fifteen minutes started an hour ago truth over fame you know i respect the blatant shit when i hear em talking i just dont know what to make of it hate is so familiar to me im slowly embracing it doesnt come natural bear with me it could take a bit yeah and my dreams are who im racing with but you can see im pacing it so that im always chasing it wayne put me right here thats who i get the paper with i hope that my success never alters our relationship yeah this life is something i would die for octobers own but its looking like july 4 i just wish theyd let you try it first this time im really going off fireworks oh today it begins ive missed them before but wont miss them again i keep having the same dream and i think that i just realized what it means im just such a gentleman you should give it up for me look at how im placing all my napkins and my cutlery i could tell it wasnt love i just thought youd fuck with me who couldve predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me damn i kept my wits about me luckily what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me now all of a sudden these gossip rags want to cover me and you making it seem like it happened that way because of me but i was curious and ill never forget it baby what an experience you couldve been the one but it wasnt that serious there was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it that felt good all in all i learned a lesson from it though you never see it coming you just get to see it go yeah i shouldve looked up in the sky at first now i can see it in her eyes fireworks oh today it begins ive missed them before but wont miss them again i keep having the same dream and i think that i just realized what it means everythings the same but it feels different my dad called me up knowing that i still listen and hes still got his foot out guilt tripping its been years though i just learn to deal with it for real me and my realtor we built up a better rapport got my mother in a place with some better decor she searched the entire city i let her explore and now shes saying shes more lonely than ever before how many of our parents marriages lasted i was only 5 i bet i barely reacted im flying back home for the heritage classic searching for that feeling tell me where is the magic lets stay together til were ghosts i want to witness love i never seen it close yeah but i guess i gotta find it first thats why im really going off fireworks oh today it begins ive missed them before but wont miss them again i keep having the same dream and i think that i just realized what it means things have been so crazy and hectic i shoulda gotten back by now but you know how much i wanted to make it its probably better anyhow so if you gotta go if theres anything i should know if the spotlight makes you nervous if youre looking for a purpose you put the tea in the kettle and light it put your hand on the metal and feel it but do you even feel it anymore i remember when you thought i was joking now im off singing karaoke further than ive ever been so if you gotta go if theres any way i can help isnt it ironic that the girl i want to marry is a wedding planner that tells me my life is too much and then moves to atlanta damn of all the places you could go i just thought youd choose somewhere that had somebody that you know im always up too late i worry bout you there alone in that place you call your home warm nights and cold patron i hope you dont get known for nothing crazy cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady i know they say the first love is the sweetest but that first cut is the deepest i tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets secrets you were telling everybody but me dont be fooled by the money im still just young and unlucky im surprised you couldnt tell i was only trying to get ahead i was only trying to get ahead but the spotlight makes you nervous and youre looking for a purpose i was only trying to get ahead i was only trying to get ahead but the spotlight makes you nervous yesterday when we were getting high you were invited you woulda liked it ii i know you all too well i said that we could kiss the past goodbye but you werent excited theres no way to fight it you can stay but shawty here i go should i spend a weekend in vegas im living inside a moment not taking pictures to save it i mean how could i forget my memorys never faded i cant relate to these haters my enemies never made it i am still here with who i started with the game needed life i put my heart in it i blew myself up im on some martyr shit carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship im 23 with a money tree growing more too i just planted a hundred seeds its ironic cause my mother was a florist and thats how she met my pops and now my garden is enormous its happening penny lane just like you said i avoided the coke game and went with sprite instead uhhuh thats word to the millions that they putting up im trying to do better than good enough what am i afraid of this is supposed to be what dreams are made of but people i dont have the time to hang with always look at me

what i said but later doesnt always come so instead its okay you could thank me now mahalo from the hardest act to follow lately ive been drinking like theres a message in a bottle alohas to women with no ties to men that i know well that way there are no lies you can thank me now for all the info i give to you niggas im on the brink of influential im here for you niggas i guess a hit doesnt add up to a career for you niggas i must have been hard to watch what a year for you niggas its december 31st and we in miami just meditating you got your resolutions we just got reservations living out a dream it feels like i stayed up and we just want to party patron straight up fuck that old shit im on new things ovo clique red wing boot gang yeah we want it all half was never the agreement who would have thought the route wed chosen would ever end up this scenic i can relate to kids going straight to the league when they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed and thats around the time that your idols become your rivals you make friends with mike but got to ai him for your survival damn i swear sports and music are so synonymous cause we want to be them and they want to be us so on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment that you take for granted you can thank me now and oh my goodness youre welcome youre welcome at this point me is who i am trying to save myself from rappers hit me up and i never know what to tell them cause they think that i can help them get back to where they fell from but drink up cause everyone here is good tonight except the niggas that i came with they good for life thats how you know its going down in case another chance never comes around you could thank me now go head thank me later yeah i know what i said but later doesnt always come so instead its okay you could thank me now shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming i think im spending all my time with the wrong women i think ill have a chance at love and knowing me ill miss it cause me dedicating my time just isnt realistic man the good girls went silent on me they got a boyfriend or left for college on me and all the bad ones i used to hit are friends now that make me wish i had a little less mileage on me but do i ever come up in discussion over double pump lattes and low fat muffins do i or is missing what we had out of the question im probably just the reason that you learned your lesson i got flows for the marilyn monroes who was there before it all i guess thats how it goes they hear about your cons but focus on your pros and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul but those same ones from your area will grow into women that are ready to get married at hello because of what they allowed where are they all now i know theyre somewhere watching so im trying to make them proud searching for the meaning youll find it next to me they tell me im the hottest guess we finally get to see im feeling like nas who am i to disagree they say the doors will open up soon as you find the missing key thats probably why im in this bitch shining jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment i rep the atf in case you need to be reminded and the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it im sorry poolside drinking margarita rounds shout out to my city though i hardly be in town im the black sheep but chris farley wears the crown and i know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down im in a world where things are taken never given how long they choose to love you will never be your decision and im aware that this could be the last time you listen so while im still here in this position you could thank me now go head thank me later yeah i know what i said but later doesnt always come so instead its okay you could thank me now these are my one st thomas flows me my niggas and some madonna hoes that look just like virgins but trust they down to go discussing life and all our common goals smart kids that smoke weed honor roll look how the champagne diamonds glow fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low im in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling whatever it is i got its clearly appealing these other rappers getting that inferior feeling i hope you feel it in your soul spiritual healing take a look at yourself the mirrors revealing if you aint got it you aint got it the theory is brilliant people ask how music is going i heard it pays i just came off making two million in 30 days damn i guess it does is what the message was sometimes i feel i be spending my money just because with weezy im just out here repping us til i get to shake the hand of the man thats blessing us yeah i know these niggas miss the mean lyrics kush got the room smelling like teen spirit i ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up until i lose for now im the games single leader i fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up and book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up who you like tell me who it is imma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list i should call it a night but fuck it i cant resist this one is for all the niggas from my city

women will complain develop hatred for men and say that youre the one to blame tryin to enjoy myself with tez in miami at the game i just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne its a weight thats on my chest whoever spotting me is playing so im lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain hoping western union doing currency exchange cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed like how i had a rolls and i went and got a range and he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change damn and i can only feel his pain cause in memphis tennessee theres only so much to attain so im filling out the form at the counter once again he say he love me i just hope he doesnt say that shit in vain im why your girl heart is in a sling call me heartbreak drake im the hardest one to tame as a man im just honest as an artist im a king with my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain yeah and see this is the thang what they viewing as bragging is the way that i maintain the shit i write while staring out the window of a plane is the singlehanded reason i remain me yeah uh i said i call this shit the calm but im the furthest thing from calm swear im putting

kicking out feedback and i entertain it as if i need that i had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that my privacy about the only thing i need back but its hard to think of them polite flows when stefano pilati suits are your night clothes and jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes and you still make it even when they say your flight closed eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows life was so full now this shit just being lipod always said id say it all on the right track but in this game you only lose when you fight back black diamond bracelets showing you the basics i cant live and hold the camera someone gotta tape this and make hits like a bitch thats married i aint miss 24 hours from greatness im that close dont ever forget the moment you began to doubt transitioning from fitting in to standing out los angeles cabanas or atlanta south watchin hovs show embarrassed to pull my camera out and my mother embarrassed to pull my phantom out so i park about five houses down she say i shouldnt have it until i have the crown but i dont wanna feel the need to wear disguises around so she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus but yet im rolling round the fuckin city like your highness got niggas reactin without a sinus cause what im working with is timeless and promoters try to get me out to they club and say i have fun but i cant imagine how cause i just seen my exgirl standing with my next girl standing with the girl that im fuckin right now and shit could get weird unless they all down and so i stay clear we from a small town and everybody talks and

i envy omar because so far im nowhere close to malik and deja and thats some higher learning trying to excel with the brake on ill have you stuck in the same spot with the tires burnin and im a liar turnin 19 jaded with no faith in any female thats askin what i was earnin i met this recent lady she knew a piece of sadie by spinners i guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby cause she aint give me the butterflies that aleshia gave me its like im using some bread to sop up some decent gravy now im out of both and ive been thinkin of alisha lately im all alone i got a feelin its on cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin is gone and uh loves lost loves gone love lost love is gone some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces circling workplaces and following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is they get to first bases then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin he wanna know what the first trace is now you like macgyver cause you sneakin around and she dont know that you there when you standin right beside her i can relate to that i had to take it back a couple a years when some of the

damn ive been trying to get at you all week why dont you call me back okay i lied damn i swear just call me back yeah this dedicated to canada man the whole up north a lot of people dont realize how cold it gets during the winter but listen i met this new girl late june or early july i called her a bunch of times but she barely replied now its december im driving and shes like wheres my hi its weird that i never called you cause i rarely get shy see that was a segue i believe the matter is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter where the timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up where girls become exes from summers caught hoin the winter cars come out the summer cars go in and some places is breezy and some it start snowin and if you planning family vacations you better know when but some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity cause mom stays up late she seen them videos where cancun college students pouring water on their titties yeah man its a funny thing going through the winter up here man a lot of girls yknow wanna get close you might think they the one but just wait nah mean take it slow forget to mention this girl that never gets to the beach she lives just west of my street and so we destined to meet since im driving i ask her how to get to the suite she doesnt answer opens the door and just gets in the seat she throws her bag in the back and starts adjusting the heat shes bold but i roll with it im impressed cause shes sweet then she says i heard your song and im obsessed with the beat i mean the lyrics are good but im obsessed with the beat i love it when voyce sings and the chorus is good theres a couple things in the song that i suggest you repeat off this im kinda taken back for a second i get her number she tells me to call her after this session and so i do and its kind of awkward the surface hard to scratch until we end up sexin and now my heart attached im thinkin off i shouldve been more southern and realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin and ho yeah uh i told yall i had a story for you right uh ya man its what it is and now im proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench she love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench but my boy say im actin different because i lay downtown and i still i rush to pick her up from work and fizzench she tellin everyone imma hold here down tell everyone im the prince up in this cold clear town and stupid me i just listen to her instead of wondering if this is really gon last me the whole year round but then spring shows up and its dallas in this bitch the weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed when we were together it seeming like way back when ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in see she used to play piana and now she never wait for santa instead of saving for marriage she saving for caribana and its a shame she had me convinced that she couldve been a dime i guess i lost another one to the wintertime give me a second to gather my thoughts and watching winter turn to spring such a beautiful day man yeah man you know we had to switch it on em right strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing im still standing on two feet even after this tragic loss man but i got something to else to tell ya baby i remember them encore pms breakfast and the wake up now drakes committed we waiting on the breakup so we can get back to them cognac nights with dress codes and light skinned girls that wont act right and i laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild the winter came and blew his cold air through back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her by the end of the week i would know that crew and wed assembled a trio a whole new scene with three ladies in the shot we never broke routine at the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin we had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen but this summer is different its a two man operation granted the fact that we one man short got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation cause handlin crack is a one man sport instead of dressup i walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin i find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin the face the breast the bras the toes im still solo and a long night draws to a close cause its a fact if she come to the crib and i get some ass inside well never talk again scary and true that song special i recorded with voyce well its like a classified its what im lookin for to carry me through yet i cant seem to find it every girl that possesses it only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit and when they talk about they past and lovers and you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others yet you find peace with yourself now least theres some room to ride theres also room for improvement as soon as june arrive strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spring yeah ho its drake uh uh ho do that dance do that dance you special girl dont leave me baby to find another just like you wont be easy baby so at least i know where the ones at baby just promise me if you go that youll come back look i ought to be thankful with women i have plenty of luck and when it comes to relationships many is stuck look at fifty you make love thirty you have sex somewhere around the tender age of twenty you fuck or maybe before im here waiting to score its long gone like brothers having a tape in their car instead these girls taking it raw now they tell you to do whatever you want because its safe to explore forget wait till its right now its wait till its more wait till he get gets a deal girl wait till the tour so they dance to attract me advance and attack me to the point that drake compare me to anthony mackie but once they have my pants and my khakis i tell them im not one for commitment and romancing exactly because i hate waking up undressed with a dame and guessing her name i hope this shit is destined to change i dont get it its like my fairy was sick its like i meet the perfect girl and she put me through some various shit its something that i can rarely predict all i know is that i can never find the love that tyler perry depict im guessing maybe shemar moore isnt really all pure maybe i lie to myself and its like a small cure i tell it all to her i gotta feeling this feeling inside is something its like and cant be all sure because really what is a window without a car door why i cant settle for one instead of all four mu mind is clouded this shit complex here jason tell me imma have a baby by next year psychic told me imma have three kids i dont want my daughter making a song like teairra mari did so imma change yeah this summer is grown im running along before i raise one of my own yeah because you special baby yeah this the remix right here yeah trendsetters drake its southern smoke ho yeah uh huh its trey songz and uh drakke ahahaha the boys of summer are here man ayo trey i got something mean for this one boy chances are most of the days you was lying around i made money thats why these girls eyeing me down by nineteen i might seem destined for millions promoters on my ass so im guessing they filled in i take cues from my big boy popz im the only young dude that the big boys watch they getting foul on the star but its all eyes on me like im copying some vows for the bar get it guess not picture me not strive to land in the top ten slip in the top five same thing in the top four trust im hot boy maybe even the top three trey you got me nowadays i peak they interests especially when lifes bringing them pain and lately they been stressed money making brothers should take notes see broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat somebody get the waiter they need a second plate a this knowledge if you aint got it you could catch it later my money and love is separate before i commit to date her i put a split in the middle and learn to separate her southern smoke they say he wanted the bounce back i can easily make them admit that the bounce back without knowing exactly where my accounts at yeah you best believe that i often tend to surpass what the rest achieve so they dont like me they throw parties and yet they never invite me i cant lie sometime it bother me slightly either way the true fans yell i appear calm and its obvious of who cant tell and no this aint blu cantrell this is like perfection though we both got the light complexion couple things i do damn well and the way that i jack son you figure drake knew sam l im for real though im from memphis im often labeled as trill so they stay kicking it with me like a field goal see im humble but i live fame for more deals on the table than abridge game ahh yo drake what up this is keeyaga your boy here umm i dont know why youre not picking up the phone youre probably out you know talking to lindsay lohan or will be talking to tyra banks whatever but yo check it out its your boy keeyaga im just calling to say what up havent talked to you in forever indefinitely you know we need to go you know downtown toronto kick it together and do what we gotta do but uh i gotta you know get off the phone because i have you know beyonce you know eva mendes all on the other line so yo do what you gotta do and holla at your boy man all the best peace ive been hated by many wanted by plenty disliked by some but confronted by none since they dont show me sincerity i load up lock up take shots at em i guess you could call it a parody and compared to d they onefourth from watermelon to a quarter felon dude you a pear to me if thats not how it is its how it appear to be you got blind heaters in my sweats is a mind reader and when the psychic get to touching my palm seein your physical the things that you never say to me visible especially when one of your artists feeling threatened cause im harnessing a weapon wont you pardon my reflection mirror mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage and play around to perfection im the spitting image my verbal camp is vivid i told you im spitting image it seems we often want to start but never get to finish my verbal campus is villanova and those of you feelin hova and writing college rhymes look the thrill is over let me assist you like a specialist so you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this its not a problem wit x i guess im a pessimist which means if shit goes bad i say i expected this and me and julien we never got the chance to communicate instead of understanding its a tune of hate the citys mine like oklahomas a sooner state and were gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late so why dont you walk up in the spot using less strut you aint morris chestnut you lighter and less cut and lets be honest by now you should be your own scholar you still a protege thats the reason i dont holler you got rappers being repetitive actors you stay ahead of the game im ahead of the practice boy yeah ren mof haha its drake man its drake manyeah ayo ren this that gritty shit here man ima have to tell them about i been through on this know what i mean ho southern smoke very few give you that truth its either they cant do it with lyrics or cant do it in spirit they cancel what they doin the samples that they usin cant get through the clearin ill handle it since they just cant get you to hear it my fathers early careerin forced my parents to split up my mother was a teacher my father was kind of fed up with just being a florist so the choir sang his chorus and he got back into doin what he was doing before us because money is an issue your son he gon miss you and plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too now you lookin for exes you aint never expect this you end up doing time and me i end up with a stepsis nobody passing judgment they question where the drugs went you know i hold you down because without you id be a wasnt and mommy imma support her i keep it all in order see her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border but this is my life and so the rest has kinda been cool question what i been through i write a verse addressin it and yes i might offend you picture when i was in school me being the closest thing to black and guess what rap music what i was into rest of the kids were sheltered i never liked to fight but when someone called me a nigga id punch em i couldnt help it now im grown i can say what it is its parents that got these black and filipino nannies raisin they kids and your daddy want it very right i make you happy plus im jewish he dont approve i think he want you to marry white he want sinatra at the wedding not barry white cause black is black honey even if hes very light and so i never been for dinner at they places always brutally honest and so i pin it to they faces i live it so the case is whether drake is way ahead of his time or inquisitive and racist am i hot as the rest should i strive for my spot as the best like girls with double ds i got a lot on my chest theres questions that need to be answered thats not on the test instead of starin at quizzes now its models with breasts and yes when im dismissed after a tedious listen i sit at home and say i should of been a pediatrician homie i probably couldve been on tv consistent an artist like pablo maybe peteys assistant and my mindset is come and get me im all alone at home with my mom and grandma and aint nobody runnin with me so if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady daughter and her grandson nigga get the handgun if not you gon make me call the burbs out in richmond that have you niggas laying out on the curb they some hitmen last couple of months i done probably been around the world and back and i dont wanna question half the places nick been sometimes i feel like lohan and hilary duff are the only ones with enough to feel what im about to say in this song when they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself and you do it and get the feeling its wrong that there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping and they try to make you out as a lie its ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason its a lose lose why even try when your ideas so frequently get rejected people just get neglected and they never really know how to feel phone calls is something that youre expecting for someone without the ethics and the motives to try and make them a mill you never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and they just wanna say that you aint around i mean theres always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming that you couldnt help and maybe next time you aint in town chorus x4 you gonna try to try harder cuz try harder cuz try trytrytry and the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin is fresher than most of these rappers running the game certain people will copy whats in the past to turn the profit with cash theres time i would have done it the same i mean i got me a range also got me a guilty conscience that made you tell anybody i meet that i rent sometimes i wish that i would just chilled on the sneakers and watched the game from the bleachers because im really tend to need what i spent in a house that i promised to get my mother dont compensate for the other time i wasted out late at the club instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner im working hard on the winter so this album is a labor of love you say as long as im staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats that she can rest without a toss and a turn because she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on tv thats exactly why i often get burned but im gonna try to chorus x4 what up lupe chitown check my style is very tennessee mixed with some terry kennedy people barely remember me from back in the day i done got some contacts and threw the glasses away the time it took me to get cool was a massive delay but check it gets boring growing up in memphis tryna become a pro but keep showing up apprentice mama probably wouldve done anything to prevent this cause every single time i break a board it gets expensive luckily my aunt workin as a nurse so every time i needed something she just reach up in her purse and plus shed always give me speeches on the first if im stayin in her house then i need to get some work i tell her i was there on vacation she said you need to be doing something other than skatin why dont you go kick it with your uncle in the basement imma let him know that you comin honey hes waitin so now its me in old school checkered plaid playing chess looking through some old school record ads he knew i didnt really wanna post here opened up the window and told me that the coast clear and now i coast clear take a deep breath feeling like the popes here homie this is recess this is each test lifes ever given me aplus graded by a teacher in a sweet dress yes im literally larnell lewis with a kick and a snare a kickflip in the air the kids sick denim jeans put a rip in a pair just so the space aint restricted in here breathe again think its obvious that they need my soul my cousins after doe like remifaso i said auntie this is a safe career she said drake i told you there was no skatin here so i kick push kick push kick push kick push coast fast as the wheels replaced i gotta find another hobby just to fill the space so i kick push kick push kick push kick push coast peep the way i roll just a rebel lookin for a place to go so i kick then push and coast  this the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin back back southern town fans get to tippin chasin fat stacks runnin down grands and submission i dont back track every single sound for me different i dont own no ice just got clean rap dont
